### searchFieldBackgroundImage
Makes it possible to alter the default rounded textfield of the searchbar into a custom image.

### customCancel
Customise the cancel button.

* *barColor* - background gradient of the button. (similar to navbar)
* *color* - color of the button title
* *title* - change the default *Cancel* text
* *font* - set the font of the button

Notice: This is a iOS5+ feature.

### color & font
This extended searchBar makes the TiUIView default parameters of color and font.

Use `backgroundColor` or `backgroundGradient` to get a custom searchBar view result.  

### disableSearchIcon
Remove the default search icon in the left side of the textfield.
